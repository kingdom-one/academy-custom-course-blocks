# K1 Academy: Custom Course Blocks

This is a set of readonly blocks that help a user design the course page while surfacing key data for the rest of the theme (aka Cornerstone) to make use of.

This plugin will automatically register the ACF fields it needs when activated.

## Dependencies

This plugin expects Advanced Custom Fields PRO (ACF) and Lifter LMS to be installed. If not, what are you even doing here?
